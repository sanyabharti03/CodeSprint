prob9-emotional balance checker

Aashriya recently found her childhood diary filled with random strings she used to write when she was upset or happy. Some of these strings were just gibberish, but her older self wonders:
"Was there some emotional balance even in my chaotic thoughts?"

She believes a string represents emotional balance if every character appears the same number of times.  
It doesn’t matter which characters are — just that their frequencies are equal.  
Your task is to help Aashriya find out if her string of thoughts (diary entry) was emotionally balanced or not.
